# Critical Heat Flux Prediction using 2006 Groeneveld Look-up Tables (NUREG)
The project aims to predict CHF in dynamic scenarios using a dataset derived from steady-state experiments.
The data is collected from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (U.S.NRC) library titled as “Critical Heat Flux Data Used to Generate the 2006 Groeneveld Lookup Tables (NUREG/KM-0011)”.
In all there are 7 distinguishable parameters, that are:
Tube Diameter (D), Heating Length (L), Pressure (P), Mass Flux (G), Critical Quality (X_chf), Inlet Subcooling (Dh_in), and Inlet Temperature (T_in).
The proposed AI/ML model architecture includes regression models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks built on TensorFlow and Keras.
The tools and technologies used in the project include Numpy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow for data manipulation, preprocessing, visualization, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning.
